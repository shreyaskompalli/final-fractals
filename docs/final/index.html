<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The high-level goal of this project was to write a system capable of rendering fractals (never-ending 
patterns based on mathematical equations) in real time. Our team found these types of complex patterns 
to be very visually appealing and mesmerizing to look at; furthermore, we wanted to explore real-time 
rendering, where we could continually generate a scene as we move the camera around. We decided to use 
Unity since it provided a nice starting point for real-time rendering, as this is the type of rendering 
that is done in most video games. Using the ray marching algorithm, signed distance functions (SDFs), 
    and various visual effects (both lighting and coloring), we were able to create a graphics 
system that can render any fractal pattern given its SDF. The final product allows you to configure the 
desired SDF in the code, and then interact with the scene by moving the camera around 
to view the beautiful and hypnotizing fractal from any angle or distance.

<h2>Technical Approach</h2>

<h3>
Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)
</h3>

<p>
    The ray marcher does not use traditional ray-primitive intersection functions like a ray tracer does, so we need to use 
    Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) to tell our ray marcher whether a ray intersects with a primitive. All fractals we 
    rendered in the scene are defined by SDFs. SDFs function similarly to implicit geometry, as they return the closest 
    distance from a ray to the surface of an object. We can leverage the fact that fractals have known SDFs to render very 
    detailed geometries for relatively little computational cost, as each ray will only have to do one call to the SDF per 
    step of the ray march instead of potentially millions of triangle intersection tests in a ray tracer. SDFs are great for 
    our tasks because they have many interesting properties that we can leverage to easily create highly complex geometries. 
    We can union, intersection, and subtract different shapes to create more complex ones. We can also infinitely repeat shapes 
    using modulo and reflect shapes across different planes. One example of use union and subtraction to create new objects can
     be shown in the following picture.
</p>

        <tr>
            <td align="middle">

            <figcaption align="middle">Example of Properties of SDFs</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<h3>
Ray Marcher
</h3>

<p>
Since fractals are quite complex shapes, we decided to use the ray marcher algorithm instead of the ray tracing algorithm we 
learned in class. To do that, we self-learned how to implement the ray marcher algorithm and used it to render a sphere and a 
cube. The big idea of ray marcher is that every object is defined using a signed distance function. So, instead of intersecting 
with shapes multiple times, at every step, we find the closest point from the current position to the object, and then advance 
that much distance in the direction of the ray until we are close to the object. We check whether we are close to the object by 
calculating whether the distance is small or not.
</p>

<h3>
Visual Effects
</h3>

<h4>
Fog
</h4>

<p>
Since rays were only marched for a set maximum distance to improve performance, the scene cut off in an abrupt way once the 
camera moved far away enough from the primitives.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/fog-bug.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Scene cut off example</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>
To fix this, we implemented a fog effect by linearly interpolating between the color of the primitives with the background 
color with the distance traveled by the ray as our interpolation parameter.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/fog.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Fog effect example</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<h4>
Orbit Trapping
</h4>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/julia-set.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Julia set, solid color</figcaption>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/julia-set-orbit-trapping.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Julia set with orbit trapping</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    Orbit trapping is a method of coloring fractals. Fractal SDFs are usually constructed by iteratively applying some 
    function repeatedly to some shape or point. Orbit trapping works by keeping track of the minimum distance between this 
    point and some arbitrary function. This minimum distance is then used to compute the color. This “traps” the point in a 
    shape defined by the function, which gives rise to interesting patterns based on the shape of the function. How you choose 
    the arbitrary function and how you choose to use the distance to color the final result is up to artistic preference.
  </p>

<h4>
Phong Shading
</h4>

<p>
For computing the Phong shading model, we found the value of the ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, and added them 
together to get the output. We then use these in the phong shading function by iterating through the lights in the scene, and 
calculating the diffuse and specular shading for each light, and adding it to output, which starts as ka (ambient light). We 
compute diffuse and specular shading using the two formulas from class as well, given from the lectures. Namely, diffuse 
    lighting is calculated by using <code>kd * (lightIntensity / (r * r)) * max(0, dot(n, l))</code> and specular lighting is calculated by 
using <code>ks * (lightIntensity / (r * r)) * pow(max(0, dot(n, h)), power)</code> The Phong shading value is used as a scalar for the 
sfinal color (i.e. finalColor *= phongValue). An example of phong shading in action is seen below. 
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/menger-phong.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">A menger sponge with only phong shading</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<h4>
Ambient Occlusion
</h4>

<p>
We scaled the final color by the value we get from the Ambient Occlusion calculation, similar to the Phong shading. 
When calculating the Ambient Occlusion, we iterate over some constant number of steps (5 in our case) along a ray normal to 
    the intersection point. For each step, we compute <code>pow(numSteps * stepDist - sceneSDF(intersection + normal * numSteps * stepDist), 2) / numSteps</code>. 
At the end we raise the occlusion factor to the power we passed into the function. Intuitively, this formula is computing 
the sceneSDF and checking if rays in the normal direction are occluded by other primitives. We then subtract this amount from 
the occlusion factor, which starts at 1.0.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/ambient-menger.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">A menger sponge with ambient occlusion but no shadows</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<h4>
Shadows
</h4>

<div align="center">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/menger-ambient-shadows.png" width="600px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">A menger sponge with ambient occlusion and shadows turned on</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>
    Adding shadows in ray marching is similar to adding shadows in ray tracing. We fire rays from the intersection point of the 
    camera rays and the primitives in the scene towards the light in the scene, and step along the ray, checking for intersections 
    along the way. If the ray from the intersection point to the light intersects with an object, it must be occluded, so we 
    apply a shadow to that point.
</p>

<h4>
Animation
</h4>

<p>
We have access to the <code>_Time</code> variable in Unity, which represents the time passed since the scene started. On every iteration 
in the SDF of these fractals, we took the sine of the current time to let our animation smoothly oscillate. We can add time as a parameter
    to anything in the SDF, including scale, position, rotation, and even color. This allows use to create 3D fractals that smoothly shift
    and turn over time.

<h2>A description of problems encountered and how you tackled them</h2>

        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>
Our very first bug was that our raymarcher was rendering just a black screen. We suspected this was a bug in our function that 
generates camera rays. Because shaders do not have access to a debugger or to print statements, we wrote some utility functions 
that output the direction of each camera ray as a color to the screen. It turned out that our ray generation code from project 
3-1 did not work because the convention in Unity is that the camera faces the positive z direction in camera space rather than 
the negative z direction as is convention in OpenGL. By changing the sign of the ray’s z direction, we got this basic shape to 
render.
</p>

        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is how the Menger sponge SDF looked upon first implementation. Only half of the Menger sponge was correctly rendering. 
    After looking online for solutions, we discovered an article that pointed out how the modulo function in HLSL functions 
      differently from the modulo function in some other shader languages. We replaced <code>x % y</code> in our definition with 
      <code>x - y * floor(x / y)</code> which fixed it. This differs from the default HLSL implementation of mod, <code>x - y * trunc(x / y)</code>, 
    when the <code>x / y</code> term is negative.

            <figcaption align="middle">Menger sponge with aliasing</figcaption>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    A high number of iterations on our fractal looks good when up close (as seen on the right of the above image), 
    but creates significant aliasing when viewed from afar. This is due to the high frequency of the geometry relative to the 
    low sampling frequency of far away parts of the scene. To fix this, we adapted the idea of mipmapping which we covered in 
    class: we lowered the number of fractal iterations for rays that intersect further away from the camera. This keeps the 
    detail of the scene up close and reduces aliasing for parts far away.

  <h2>
    Lessons Learned
  </h2>

  <p>
    Throughout the project, we encountered many examples of code online that used many mathematical tricks to render SDFs in 
    very few lines of code. We learned that it was more important to use a readable, well commented implementation with 
    reasonably named identifiers rather than trying to use the shortest working code snippet that we found online. We also 
    learned that programming solely in a shader came with many quirks that made debugging much more difficult than writing 
    CPU-side code, and we relied more on our programming intuition to debug than actually looking at the state of the program.
